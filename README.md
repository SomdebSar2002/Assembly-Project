# 🎮 Assembly Endgame

A **word-guessing game** built as part of a **challenge-based learning project** from the  
🎓 **Scrimba Frontend Career Path**.

The rules are simple:  
Each wrong guess makes a programming language *vanish* — like a Thanos snap 💥  
You get **8 chances** to predict the correct word and restore balance.

Good news: unlike Marvel Endgame, **no one gets hurt** — you get confetti instead 🎉

## 🧠 What This Project Is

- A **guided project** where only hints were provided  
- The implementation was done **step by step by me**
- No copy-paste solution — logic and UI were built incrementally
- A few **AI feedback nudges** were used when absolutely necessary  
  (just like *Kamaru Usman EXTRA SHOTS to Masvidal* 🥊 — precise, not spam)
